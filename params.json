It is free and open source software, distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2 or later.\r\n\r\nIt comprises code originally developed for the MOOTOMBO!WebOS, an enhanced Platform which combines a classic Content Management System (CMS) and future promised Web Application Platform (WAP). For more information about the MOOTOMBO!WebOS visit [http://mootombo.com/about](http://mootombo.com/about).\r\n\r\nFor news and information about developing with MOTOOMBO, please visit [http://developer.mootombo.org](http://developer.mootombo.org).\r\n\r\nView the MOOTOMBO!Framework API Documentation at [http://mootombo.github.com/framework](http://mootombo.github.com/framework). Powered by [phpDocumentor 2](http://www.phpdoc.org).\r\n\r\nYou can discuss MOOTOMBO!Framework development by joining the Forum at [http://devxive.com/forum/mootombo/framework](http://devxive.com/forum/mootombo/framework).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\n- PHP 5.3.10\r\n- Each package has their own requirements as well. Ex: The Image package requires the PHP GD extension. Please see the `composer.json` in each package repository for these requirements.\r\n- Applications implementing the MOOTOMBO!Framework must implement the 'MFWPATH_ROOT' constant which should be the root path of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nJust install the package as you would install any other package in MOOTOMBO!WebOS. The simplest way to get up and running with the MOOTOMBO!Framework is to use the MOOTOMBO!WebOS - Developer Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download via Git\r\n\r\n`git clone git://github.com/mootombo/framework.git`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nGeneral documentation about the MOOTOMBO!Framework can be found under the [/docs](docs/) folder of this repository. In addition, each package has a own documentation in a `README.md` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reporting Bugs and Issue\r\n\r\nBugs and issues found in the MOOTOMBO!Framework code can be reported on the [Issues](https://github.com/mootombo/framework/issues) list.
